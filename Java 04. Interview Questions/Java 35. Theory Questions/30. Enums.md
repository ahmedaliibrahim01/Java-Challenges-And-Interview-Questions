## What is enum? Can it be extended?
An enum or enumeration is a special kind of class that has a fixed set of constant (unchangeable) values.

We create an enum, by using the enum keyword.

    enum Size {
    SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
    }
Here, we have an enum named Size. It contains constant values: SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE. They are separated by commas.

Enum can't be extended. This means we cannot create a subclass of an enum because enums are inherently final and cannot be subclassed.
