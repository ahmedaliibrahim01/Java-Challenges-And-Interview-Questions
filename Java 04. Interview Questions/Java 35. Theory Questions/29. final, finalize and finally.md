## What is the difference between final, finalize and finally?
The differences between final, finalize, and finally in Java:

### final
In Java final is the keyword with variables, methods, and classes to apply some restrictions. For example, if we use final with

**Variables** - we cannot change the value of the variable
**Methods** - we cannot perform method overriding
**Classes** - we cannot inherit the class

Let us see an example of final keyword in Java.

    // create final variable
    final int number = 34;
    
    // change the value of the final variable
    number = 24;
If we try to change the value of the final variable, we will get the following error:

    error: cannot assign a value to final variable number
    number = 24;
    ^
    1 error

### finally

finally is used in a try-catch block to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

Let us see an example,

    try {
    // code that may throw an exception
    } catch (Exception e) {
    // exception handling code
    } finally {
    // cleanup operations
    // will always be executed
    }

### finalize
finalize is a method that is called by the garbage collector when an object is no longer reachable. The finalize() method performs any necessary cleanup operations before the object is destroyed.

The syntax for the finalize() method is as follows:

    protected void finalize() throws Throwable
    
    }
We can use finalize() method by overriding the method.
