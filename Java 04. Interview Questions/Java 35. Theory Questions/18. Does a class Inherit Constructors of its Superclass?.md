## Does a class inherit constructors of its superclass in Java?
In Java, a class does not inherit constructors from its superclass. However, a subclass can call the constructor of its superclass using the super keyword. For example,

    class Animal {
    public Animal() {
    // constructor code goes here
    }
    }
    
    class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog() {
    // calls the constructor of the superclass (Animal)
    super();
    }
    }
Here, the Dog class extends the Animal class and calls the constructor of the Animal class using the super.
