## What happens when the main() isn't declared as static?
Static variable, method or statement block can be called without creating any object (or instance) of the class in which it is declared.

If the main() method is not declared as static, then the JVM would have to create an instance of the class, which would require calling the constructor of the class.

However, the JVM does not know which constructor to call as there may be multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

Therefore, by declaring main() as static, we can ensure that it can be invoked without creating an instance of the class, which is necessary for the JVM to run the program.

When we execute a Java program, JVM loads the class containing the main() method and invokes it without creating an instance of the class.

This is why the main() method needs to be declared as static.
