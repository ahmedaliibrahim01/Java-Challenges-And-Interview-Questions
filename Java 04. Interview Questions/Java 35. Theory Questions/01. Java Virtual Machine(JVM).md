## What is JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.

When you write a Java program, the code is first converted into a special format called bytecode by the Java compiler.

The JVM then interprets this bytecode and converts it into machine-specific code that your computer can understand and execute.

You can write Java code once and run it on any device or platform that has a JVM installed.
