## What is a JIT Compiler?
**Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler is a type of compiler that is used to improve the performance of a Java program at runtime. It works by compiling bytecode into native machine code on the fly, as the program is executing, rather than ahead of time.

The JIT compiler is an important part of the Java runtime environment, as it allows the JVM to execute Java programs more efficiently.

It is typically transparent to the programmer and operates automatically in the background as the program runs.
