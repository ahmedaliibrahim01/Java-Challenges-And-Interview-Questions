## What's the difference between comparison done by equals method and == operator?
In Java, the equals() method is used to compare the contents of two objects, while the == operator is used to compare the references of two objects.

Let us see an example,

    class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
            String name1 = "Jack";
            String name2 = "Jack";
            String name3 = new String("Jack");
     
             // true - both variables point to the same object in memory  
            System.out.println(name1 == name2);
            
            // false - name1 and name3 are two different objects in memory
            System.out.println(name1 == name3); 
            
            // true - name1 and name3 have the same value, which is "Jack"
            System.out.println(name1.equals(name3)); 
     
        }
    }
