## Explain final variable, final method and a final class?
## Final variables
Final variables cannot modified once they have been assigned a value. They must be initialized when they are declared or in a constructor. For example,

    // create final variable
    final int number = 34;
    // change the value of the final variable
    number = 24;
    
    We have used the final keyword with the number variable. Assigning a new value to final variable will give us the following error.
---
    error: cannot assign a value to final variable number
    number = 24;
    ^
## Final methods
Final methods that can't be overridden by a subclass. For example,

    class Engine {
    
        // create a final method
        final void setEngine() { 
        }
    }
    
    class PetrolEngine extends Engine {
    
        // try to override setEngine()
        void setEngine() {
        }
    }
    
    Now, if we run this code, we will get an error.
    
    error: setEngine() in PetrolEngine cannot override setEngine() in Engine
    void setEngine() {
    ^
    overridden method is final
## Final classes
Final classes can't be inherited.For example,

    //create a final class
---
    final class Person {
    
        void getDetails() {
          
        }
    }
    
    // inherit the final class
    // error
    class Student extends Person {
    
        // overridden method
        void getDetails() {
            
        }
    }
When we run this code, we will get an error.

    Main.java:11: error: cannot inherit from final Person
    class Student extends Person {
    ^
    1 error
    
    They can contain both final and non-final methods and variables.
