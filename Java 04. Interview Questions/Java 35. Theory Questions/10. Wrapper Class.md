## What is a wrapper class in Java?
In Java, wrapper classes are classes that wrap primitive data types and provide them with object-oriented functionality. There is a wrapper class for each primitive data type in Java.

Here's a list of some primitive types along with their corresponding wrapper classes.

### Primitive Data Type
1. int
2. float
3. double
4. boolean
5. char

### Wrapper class
1. Integer
2. Float
3. Double
4. Boolean
5. Character

Since Java is an object-oriented language, sometimes we might need to use objects instead of primitive data types.

For example, while working with collections:

    // Invalid Code
    ArrayList<double> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Valid Code
    ArrayList<Double> numbers = new ArrayList<>();

In the cases like above, wrapper classes help us use primitive types as objects.
