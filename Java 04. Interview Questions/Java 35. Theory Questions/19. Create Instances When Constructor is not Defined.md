## How instances of a class are created if no constructor is defined in the class in Java?
If we didn't define any constructor inside a class, Java automatically creates a default constructor and assigns a default value to the fields of the class.

Let's see an example,

    class Student {
    
        int marks;
        
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            
            Student student1 = new Student();
            System.out.println("Marks: " + student1.marks);
        }
    }

**Output**

    Marks: 0
Here, we haven't assigned any value to the marks variable, however, we got the value 0.

It's because when we create the object

    Student student1 = new Student();
a default constructor is created, which assigns default integer value, 0 to the marks.

The above code is equivalent to

    class Student {
    
        int marks;
        
        // constructor
        Student() {
            marks = 0;
        }
        
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            
            Student student1 = new Student();
            System.out.println("Marks: " + student1.marks);
        }
    }
    
    // Output
    // Marks: 0
