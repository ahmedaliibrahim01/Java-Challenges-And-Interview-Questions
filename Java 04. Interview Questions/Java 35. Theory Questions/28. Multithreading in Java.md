## Describe the process of multithreading in Java.
Multithreading is a programming concept in which we create small unit of tasks that can execute parallely.

1. A thread is a separate flow of execution within a Java program.
2. We can create a new thread by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.
3. To start a new thread, we need to create an instance of the Thread class or Runnable interface and call the start() method on it.
4. The run() method of the Thread class or Runnable interface contains the code that will be executed by the new thread.
5. When we call the start() method, the new thread is added to the list of threads that the Java virtual machine (JVM) is executing.
6. The JVM will execute each thread concurrently, allowing multiple threads to run at the same time.

Multithreading can improve the performance of our program by allowing the CPU to switch between different threads and utilize idle time more effectively.
