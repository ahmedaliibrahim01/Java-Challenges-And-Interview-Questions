## What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
An interface is a collection of abstract methods that defines a set of behaviors that a class can implement.

An abstract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods that do not have an implementation and must be implemented by a subclass.

There are several key differences between interfaces and abstract classes in Java:

- Interfaces cannot have any implementation code, while abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods with implementation code.
- A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only extend one abstract class.
- An interface has no constructor, while an abstract class can have a constructor.
- Variables declared in an interface are automatically public, static, and final, while variables in an abstract class can have any access modifier.
