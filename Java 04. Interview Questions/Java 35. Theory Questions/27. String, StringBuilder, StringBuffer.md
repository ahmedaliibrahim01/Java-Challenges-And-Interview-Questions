## What are the differences between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
In Java, the String class represents an immutable sequence of characters. This means that once we create a String object, we cannot modify its value. If we need to modify a string, we must create a new string object.

However, StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable. This means that we can modify the value of a StringBuilder or StringBuffer object without creating a new object.

Furthermore, StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer because it is not thread-safe. This means that StringBuilder is not suitable for use in multi-threaded environments, where multiple threads may access the same object simultaneously.

Let's look at the summary of the differences between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer.



| Class         |  Mutable  | Thread-safe |
|:--------------|:---------:|------------:|
| String        | Immutable |         Yes |
| StringBuilder |  Mutable  |          No |
| StringBuffer  |  Mutable  |         Yes |
