## Can you explain the concept of a Java functional interface?
If a Java interface contains one and only one abstract method (method without a body) then it is a functional interface.

    interface AddNumber{
        void add();
    }

Here, the interface AddNumber has only one abstract method add(). Hence, it is a functional interface.

We can also use @FunctionalInterface annotation to indicate an interface as a functional interface.

    @FunctionalInterface  
    interface AddNumber{
        void add(); 
    }

@FunctionalInterface annotation allows only one abstract method.
