## What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?
Some of the key differences between heap memory and stack memory are:

Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.Stack memory contains local variable, and reference of an object. When we create an object it is stored in heap memory and the reference of the object is stored in the stack memory.
The objects in the heap are globally accessible whereas stack memory can't be accessed by other threads.
Stack memory uses LIFO technique to manage memory. Whereas it's more complex in Heap memory because it's used globally. Heap memory is divided into Young-Generation, Old-Generation etc.
