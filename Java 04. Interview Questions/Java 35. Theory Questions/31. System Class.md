## What is a System class in Java?
System class is a predefined class in the Java programming language that provides access to system resources and information.

For example, we can use the System class to print a message to the screen. Notice the code snippet below:

    class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
    }
This program will print the message "Hello, world!" to the screen when it is run. Here, the System class is used to access the out field, which is a PrintStream object that can be used to write data to the standard output stream (usually the screen).

System class belongs to the java.lang package. The System class is a final class and you cannot inherit this class to override its methods.

Here are some important feature of the System class.

- Standard input and output
- Error output streams
- Access to externally defined properties and environment variables
- Built-in utility for copying a part of an array
- Provides means for loading files and libraries
