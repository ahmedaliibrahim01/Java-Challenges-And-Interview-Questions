## Can a constructor be made final?
No, a constructor cannot be made final in Java. For example,

    class Test {
    
        // error code
        final Test () {
            
        }
    }
If we try to make a constructor final, we get the following error;

    Main.java:3: error: modifier final not allowed here
    final Test () {
    ^

Final methods prevents overriding. Constructors are also the special kind of methods but constructor cannot be inherited in subclass, hence there is no use of final keyword with constructor.
