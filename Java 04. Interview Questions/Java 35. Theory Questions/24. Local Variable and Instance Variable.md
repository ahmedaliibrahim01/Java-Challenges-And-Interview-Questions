## Can you explain the difference between a local variable and an instance variable in Java?
In Java instance variable is a variable that is declared within the class (outside method) and is associated with the object of the class.

    public class Person {
    
        // instance variable
        private String name; 
    }
We can access the instance variable from method or constructor of the same class or its subclasses.

    public static void main (String[] args) {
    
        Person obj = new Person();
        
        // access instance variable name 
        obj.name = "Simmy";
    }
The lifetime of an instance variable is tied to the lifetime of the object they belong to.

On the contrary, a local variable is defined within a method or a block of code.

    public void add() {
    int number = 11;
    }
Local variables are only visible and can be accessed within the method or block in which they are defined.

    public void print() {
    
        // error code
        // cannot access local variable number
        System.out.println(number);
    }
They are created when the method or block is entered and destroyed when it exits, and their lifetime is limited to the execution of the code that defines them.
