## Programming languages like C/C++ use pointers. Why does Java not make use of pointers?
Java doesn't make use of pointer because of following reasons;

### To prevent direct memory manipulation

Pointers are variables that hold memory addresses, and they can be used to directly manipulate memory.

One can access some arbitrary memory location and do read and write operations on it. This introduces bugs and security vulnerabilities into a program.

### Easy memory management

Pointers can be used to allocate and deallocate memory. However, it is tiresome for programmers to manage memory manually.

As java provides the automatic garbage collection feature so there is no need of pointers and it makes memory management easier.

### Concept of reference

Java doesn't provide any explicit option to use pointers but they are used internally

Java has the concept of reference which is more simple and secure than pointer. Using Java reference you cannot directly access the memory address it points.
