## Why do you need to use synchronized methods or blocks?
As Java supports multi-threading, two or more threads might try to access the same resource at the same time. This can cause problems if the threads are not properly synchronized.

To prevent these types of problems, we can use the synchronized keyword to synchronize access to shared resources. When a method or block of code is marked as synchronized, only one thread can execute the code at a time.

We can use the synchronized keyword as:

class Main {
private int counter = 0;

    // this indicates only one thread can execute incrementCounter() at a time
    // such that the value of the counter variable is updated correctly 
    public synchronized void incrementCounter() {
        counter++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main();
        main.incrementCounter();
    }
}
