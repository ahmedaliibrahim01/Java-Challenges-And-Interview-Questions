## Does Java support global variables? Why/Why not?
Java does not have the concept of global variables in the way that some other programming languages do.

In Java, all variables must be declared within a class, and they are only accessible within the method in which they are declared or within methods defined in the same class. This is because Java follows Encapsulation.

Overall, the lack of global variables in Java is a design feature that helps to promote good programming practices and makes it easier to write robust and maintainable code.
