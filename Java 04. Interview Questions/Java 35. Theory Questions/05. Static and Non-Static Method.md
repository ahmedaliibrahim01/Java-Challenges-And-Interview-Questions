## Can you explain the difference between a static and non-static method in Java?
A static method in Java is a method that is associated with a class rather than an instance of the class. This means that you can call a static method without creating an instance of the class.

A non-static method is a method that is associated with an instance of a class and can only be called on an instance of the class.

Some of the differences between static and non-static methods are:

- Static methods have class-level scope, while non-static methods have object-level scope.
- Static methods are stored in the class-level memory area, while non-static methods are stored in the heap.
- Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods within the class. Non-static methods can access both static and non-static variables and methods within the class.
