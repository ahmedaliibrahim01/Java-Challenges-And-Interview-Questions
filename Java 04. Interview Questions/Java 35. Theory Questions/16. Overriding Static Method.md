## Why is it not possible to override the static method?
No, we cannot override static methods because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at runtime and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time.

If we try to override the static method of the derived class the method gets hidden by the static method of the base class.

    class Base {
    
        // static method 
        public static void print() {
            System.out.println("Hello! from base class");
        }
    }
    
    class Derived extends Base {
    
        // overide print() method of Base class
        public static void print() {
            System.out.println("Hello! from derived class");
        }
    }
    class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
            Base baseObj = new Base();
            baseObj.print();
            
            Base derivedObj = new Derived();
            derivedObj.print();
        }
    }

**Output**

    Hello! from base class
    Hello! from base class
As you can see, even when we call the overridden method of the Derived class, the static method from the Base class is called by Java.

Moreover, when we declare static method, it means it is a common method. There is no point in overriding and changing the working of the method that is supposed to be common.
