## Area of Two Triangles

### Problem Description
Create a program to find the area of two triangles.

The formula to compute the area of a triangle is:

    area = (base * height) / 2

**Step 1:**

- Create a class named Triangle with integer fields base and height.
- Create a constructor with integer parameters b and h.
- Inside the constructor, initialize the base and height with values of b and h respectively.
- Create a method named calculateArea() to compute the area of triangle using the above formula and print it.

**Step 2:**

- Create the main() method inside a Main class.
- Inside the method, create an object t1 of the Triangle class with arguments 5 and 14.
- Call the calculateArea() method using the object.
- Create a second object t2 of Triangle with arguments 12 and 32.
- Call calculateArea() using the second object.
