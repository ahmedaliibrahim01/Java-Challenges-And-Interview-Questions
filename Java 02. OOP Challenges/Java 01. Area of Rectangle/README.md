## Area of Rectangle

### Problem Description
Create a program to find the area of a rectangle.

The formula to compute the area of a rectangle is:

    area = length * breadth

**Step 1:**

- Create a class named Rectangle with two integer fields length and breadth.
- Create a constructor with integer parameters x and y.
- Inside the constructor, initialize the value of length and breadth with x and y respectively.
- Create a method named calculateArea() that computes the area using the above formula and prints it.

**Step 2:**

- Create a main() method inside the Main class.
- Inside the method, get two integer inputs for variables x and y.
- Create an object of the Rectangle class and pass x and y as the argument to the Rectangle() constructor.
- Call the calculateArea() method using the object.
