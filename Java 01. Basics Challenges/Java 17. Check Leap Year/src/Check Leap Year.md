Check Leap Year
-
Problem Description
-
Create a program to check if a year is a leap year or not.

A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending by 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.

- Get an integer year input for the year variable.
- Use the if condition to check if the year is perfectly divisible by 400. If true, print Leap Year.
- Use an else if condition to check if the year is perfectly divisible by 4 and doesn't end with 00 (not divisible by 100). If true, print Leap Year.
- Otherwise, print Not a Leap Year.
