A Harshad number is an integer which is divisible by the sum of its digits. For example, 21 which is perfectly divided by 3 (sum of digits: 2 + 1).

- Get an integer input for a variable number.
- Run a while loop to access each digit of number.
- Inside the loop, find the sum of each digit of number.
- Check if the number is perfectly divisible by the sum.
- If the number is divisible by the sum, print Harshad Number. Otherwise, print Not a Harshad Number.
